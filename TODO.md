# TODOs

## Overall

- [ ] Rethink about config options  
(Currently, many options originated from yatt\_lite have the same names as their originals to reduce errors of code porting)

## Core Codegen Layer

- [ ] xhf tests

- [ ] Complete sourcemap support
- more builtin macros
   - [ ] `yatt:if`
   - [ ] `yatt:my`
- [ ] default values
- [ ] ts-native types
- [ ] generate without types?

## For Generic Web App Support

- [ ] Platform neutral yatt runtime?

   - [ ] `app.render()`, `app.do()`??

     - [ ] Throw/Catch special response

     - [ ] Sigil mappings for pages and actions

     - [ ] Inline route for yatt:page decls

- [ ] Platform neutral directory organization for entities, pages, widgets and components?
